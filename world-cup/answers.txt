Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
Small N such as N = 10 and N = 100

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
I think it starts to stablize after N = 1000
