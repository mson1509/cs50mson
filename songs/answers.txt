If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
    Their audio aura is a bit moody and sad but still enjoyable and groovy!
Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
    I would include the number of replays for each songs when calculating.
